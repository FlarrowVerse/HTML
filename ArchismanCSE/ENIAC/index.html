            The <u>ENIAC</u> was invented by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania 
            and began construction in 1943 and was not completed until 1946. It occupied about <u>1,800</u> square 
            feet and used about 18,000 vacuum tubes, weighing almost 50 tons. The construction work was led by 
            General Gladeon M. Barnes, costing about <u>487,000 USD</u>.ENIAC was a modular computer, composed of individual panels to perform different functions. Twenty of these modules were accumulators that could not only add and subtract, but hold a ten-digit decimal number in memory. Numbers were passed between these units across several general-purpose buses (or trays, as they were called). In order to achieve its high speed, the panels had to send and receive numbers, compute, save the answer and trigger the next operation, all without any moving parts. Key to its versatility was the ability to branch; it could trigger different operations, depending on the sign of a computed result.

            ENIAC was designed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert of the University of Pennsylvania, U.S.[13] The team of design engineers assisting the development included Robert F. Shaw (function tables), Jeffrey Chuan Chu (divider/square-rooter), Thomas Kite Sharpless (master programmer), Frank Mural (master programmer), Arthur Burks (multiplier), Harry Huskey (reader/printer) and Jack Davis (accumulators).[14] In 1946, the researchers resigned from the University of Pennsylvania and formed the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation.
